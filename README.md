# EEG_Experiment_Shell

This code creates a simple experiment where 5 faces are shown randomly interspersed with 5 images of houses. The participant pushes "4" if there is a face, "6" for an object. EEG output is recorded. This type of experiment is expected to show a negative component around 170 ms after image presentation. The component will be significantly larger to faces vs. houses, typically around the right fusiform gyrus (N170).
